# amalthea2021
This is the website of the technical summit of IIT Gandhinagar known as Amalthea.

----------------------------------------------------------


The repository contains 4 HTML files namely, index.html, About.html, Events.html, Sponsors.html, and only 1 CSS file named as app.css. Styles of all pages are included in the app.css file. The repository contains the folder named as "Images" which contains all the logos, posters, and the video. 

I have used the video and the posters from the instagram account of Amalthea.
