                            <p>AutoDesk Fusion 360 is an essential software for students. It's the first 3D CAD, CAM,
                                and CAE tool of its kind, connecting your entire product development process into one
                                cloud-based platform. Fusion 360 helps students and educators prepare for the future of
                                design.
                                Amalthea brings to you a great opportunity to master this software and add to your
                                skillset! In the Fusion 360 Design Contest, students will submit a model based on the
                                problem statement, which will be released a day before the contest starts.
                                The best part, we will be conducting a workshop on how to use Fusion 360, which will be
                                taught by expert instructors from AutoDesk ! The workshop and the contest is open to
                                all, and has no participation fee.

                                — Victor Hugo
                            <p>ICon (Innovative Conference) is an event which aims to bring hidden/unknown ideas/
                                innovations in front of the world. By bringing together, we create a unique platform for
                                participants to learn, exchange ideas and collaborate with experts.
                                The year 2020 brought various kinds of crises which changed our lives drastically. From
                                the COVID-19 Pandemic to Forest Fires in Australia, crashing world economies to ravaging
                                floods, these emerging crises have not only made our lives more vulnerable, but also
                                warned us of the problems we may face in the future. So, we would like to invite
                                projects based on the topic - “Engineering Solutions to Emerging Crisis”.
                                The participants will be allotted a time slot of 10 minutes in which they would be
                                expected to do a presentation of their scheme and can demonstrate their idea. During
                                this time, they need to showcase the significant points of their project and present it
                                to the experts. This shall be followed by a short questionnaire by the experts.</p>
